# Data Structures & Algorithms - Interview Preparation

This repository contains a collection of solutions to commonly asked Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) problems, optimized for technical interview preparation. The solutions are structured to demonstrate efficient problem-solving techniques and include explanations for each approach.

## Topics Covered

- **Arrays**
- **Hashing**
- **Two Pointers**
- **Sliding Window**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal portfolio for my DSA practice, providing clean, optimized code for each problem along with detailed explanations. It is designed to showcase my understanding and readiness for technical interviews.

## Structure

- Each problem is organized in a separate file with the problem statement, approach, and code solution.
- Each solution follows best practices in terms of time and space complexity to ensure maximum efficiency.
- Explanations accompany each solution to detail the reasoning behind the approach and to provide clarity on the algorithm used.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/DSA-InterviewPrep.git
